    <h1 id="help">How to get ladder climb:</h1>
    I don't know about windows/mac yet<br>
    This game might be boring, because this game runs IN TERMINAL, and also I am bad at coding c++, but if you still want to play it then here's how you can open it:<br>
      <strong>Texts highlighted in BLACK means to copy & paste</strong>
    <h3>Chromebook:</h3>
    Go to settings app and find "Linux Development Enviroment" install that, now follow the steps for linux, as the steps are the same.
    <h2>Linux:</h2>
      1: Go to terminal<br>
      2: Copy the command:<br>
    <code>sudo apt update</code><br>
      3: Skip step 3, 4, and 5 if you already have c++ installed, but if don't have c++ installed, then copy this command:<br>
    <code>sudo apt install g++</code><br>
      4: When downloading c++, it'll ask you if you want to install c++ or not, type "<code>y</code>" to install<br>
      5: Now wait until c++ is installed on the terminal<br>
      6: Now that you have c++ installed, <a href="https://nicecat99.github.io/resource/ladder-climb.cpp" download>Download ladder climb</a><br>
      7: <strong>FOR CHROMEBOOK ONLY</strong>: drag "ladder_climb.cpp" to linux files in files app<br>
      8: <strong>FOR LINUX ONLY</strong>: Make sure the file path is "<code>/home/</code>[your username]<code>/ladder_climb.cpp</code>" replace [your username] with your username<br>
      9: On terminal copy the two LAST COMMANDS:<br>
      <code>c++ ladder_climb.cpp</code><br>
    After you did it, type in the last command:<br>
      <code>./a.out</code><br>
    And there you go!<br>
